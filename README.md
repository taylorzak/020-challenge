# Horiseon semantic work

Since this is my first time attempting this and also writing a 'README.md' explaining what I did, I kept it simple and hope to improve over next few months in this class. I would have liked to move some boxes around and extend them to fit and change fonts and colors but that did not seem to be required. 

## Changes made in this webpage are as follows:

Changed the title to 'Horiseon search'.

The link was fixed that did not work when clicking on 'Search engine optimization' that took you to the bottom of the page.

I added 'alt' attributes to the main picture, the three smaller pictures in the links and also the three icons to the lower right.

I noticed there were redundant CSS entries so I deleted the unecessary ones and re-named the first in the series. 

I am learning to try to make the lines in the HTML 'cleaner' and perhaps easier to read. Indenting sections and giving more adequate spacing.

I changed my 'div's and classified them in the body. 'aside', 'nav', 'section' and 'article'. I think this could be considered 'refactoring'?

I did decide to change the footer to an H2 size after going through all of the sizes. 

I feel I followed the acceptance criteria as best I could. Attached is a mock-up. No changes to any visuals on the webpage.
